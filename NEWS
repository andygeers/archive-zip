<b>NOTE:</b> Date stamps in the following entries are in YYYY/MM/DD format.


== v0.3.0 (2009/01/23)

* Made a significant performance improvement for the extraction of compressed
  entries for performance on par with InfoZIP's unzip.  Parsing archives with
  many entries is still a bit subpar however.


== v0.2.0 (2008/08/06)

* Traditional (weak) encryption is now supported.
* Adding new encryption methods should be easier now.
* Fixed a bug where the compression codec for an entry loaded from an archive
  was not being recorded.
* The _compression_codec_ attribute for Entry instances is now used instead of
  the _codec_ attribute to access the compression codec of the entry.


== v0.1.1 (2008/07/11)

* Archive files are now closed when the Archive::Zip object is closed even when
  no changes were made to the archive, a problem on Windows if you want to
  delete the archive after extracting it within the same script.


== v0.1.0 (2008/07/10)

* Initial release.
* Archive creation and extraction is supported with only a few lines of code.
  (See README)
* Archives can be updated "in place" or dumped out to other files or pipes.
* Files, symlinks, and directories are supported within archives.
* Unix permission/mode bits are supported.
* Unix user and group ownerships are supported.
* Unix last accessed and last modified times are supported.
* Entry extension (AKA extra field) implementations can be added on the fly.
* Unknown entry extension types are preserved during archive processing.
* Deflate and Store compression codecs are supported out of the box.
* More compression codecs can be added on the fly.
